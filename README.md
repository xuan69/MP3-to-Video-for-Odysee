# MP3-to-Video-for-Odysee
I wanted to create videos with just a static background from a folder containing MP3's and also match the recommended MP4 format for **Odysee** video platform, but this also works for Youtube.

## What you need to install
You will need to **install FFMPEG**, it will perform the conversion from MP3 audio to MP4 video.

Download it from GitHub at **[https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer?tab=readme-ov-file)**

**Download the full FFMPEG package and install, place the picture** you want as a background in the same folder of the batch **name it background.jpg**

**Download the batch file that best matches your computer specification**, I have two version one that uses the **[NVIDIA GPU](https://github.com/xuan69/MP3-to-Video-for-Odysee/blob/1d5900655d01ecd8f6ef09fa12d1ede3e05babba/batch%20files/convert%20to%20Odysee%20(nvidia).bat)** and one that uses just **[CPU only](https://github.com/xuan69/MP3-to-Video-for-Odysee/blob/1d5900655d01ecd8f6ef09fa12d1ede3e05babba/batch%20files/convert%20to%20Odysee%20(cpu).bat)**

When you run the batch file it convert all the MP3's in that folder and make them into MP4's.
