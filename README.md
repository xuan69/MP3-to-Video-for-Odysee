# MP3-to-Video-for-Odysee
I wanted to create videos from MP3's with just a static background and also match the recommended MP4 format for Odysee video platform, but also works for Youtube.

You will need to **install FFMPEG** that will do the conversion.

Download it from GitHub at **https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer?tab=readme-ov-file**

**Download the full FFMPEG package and install, place the picture** you want as a background in the same folder of the batch name it **background.jpg**

When you run my batch file it take all the MP3's in that folder and make them into MP4's
